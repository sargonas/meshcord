A Discord bridge for Meshtastic networks that automatically forwards messages and network activity to a Discord channel. Stay up to date with what's happening on your mesh network even when you're away from your radio! Great for those of us with home base station units who want to see what traffic has been going on when away from our daily driver mobile nodes.

## Features

### Serial Connection
- **Direct USB connection** - Maximum reliability through direct serial communication
- **Real-time message delivery** - Receives packets instantly as they arrive at the radio

### Smart Message Handling
- **Real-time Discord integration** - Messages appear instantly in your Discord channel
- **Signal strength reporting** - Optional SNR and RSSI data display
- **Discord timestamps** - Shows time in each user's local timezone
- **Duplicate prevention** - Automatic deduplication of repeat messages
- **Persistent node database** - Remembers node names across restarts and matches them to radio hashes

### Flexible Message Filtering
- **Granular control** - Choose which message types to forward to Discord
- **Smart node identification** - Shows friendly node names instead of their hex IDs (once at least one info packet has been received from that node)
- **Enhanced message formatting** - Rich Discord messages with radio source identification, and location links (when available)

### Data Management
- **Automatic database cleanup** - Configurable retention for processed messages
- **Node information tracking** - Stores and displays node names and details based on info packets
- **Message deduplication** - Prevents duplicate messages from being forwarded

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended) OR Python 3.8+ and python modules from requirements.txt
- Discord bot token and channel ID
- Meshtastic device with USB serial connection

### 1. Clone and Configure (optional)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sargonas/meshcord.git
cd meshcord
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Set Up Discord Bot
1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot and copy the token
3. Add bot to your server with "Send Messages" permission
4. Get your channel ID (Enable Developer Mode ‚Üí Right-click channel ‚Üí Copy ID)

### 3. Configure Environment (Only needed if optional step 1 chosen, otherwise these values are set in Docker Compose)
Edit `.env` with your settings:
```bash
# Required
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here

# Serial connection
CONNECTION_METHOD=serial
SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0  # Your serial device path
```

### 4. Deploy

#### Option A: Using Pre-built Docker Image (Recommended)
```bash
# Create data volume
docker volume create meshcord_data

# Run with Docker directly (serial connection)
docker run -d \
  --name meshcord-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here \
  -e DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here \
  -e CONNECTION_METHOD=serial \
  -e SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  -v meshcord_data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/sargonas/meshcord:latest

# Check logs
docker logs -f meshcord-bot
```

#### Option B: Using Docker Compose with Pre-built Image
Create a simple `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  meshcord:
    image: ghcr.io/sargonas/meshcord:latest
    container_name: meshcord-bot
    restart: unless-stopped
    devices:
      - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"  # Map your USB device
    environment:
      DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
      DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID: ${DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID}
      CONNECTION_METHOD: serial
      SERIAL_PORT: /dev/ttyUSB0
      DEBUG_MODE: ${DEBUG_MODE:-false}
    volumes:
      - meshcord_data:/app/data

volumes:
  meshcord_data:
    external: true
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f meshcord
```

#### Option C: Build from Source
```bash
# Create data volume
docker volume create meshcord_data

# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f meshcord
```

## Configuration Options

### Serial Connection
```bash
CONNECTION_METHOD=serial
SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0  # Linux/macOS
# or
SERIAL_PORT=COM3          # Windows (when running natively)
```

**Serial Connection Requirements:**
- Direct USB connection to Meshtastic device
- Proper device permissions (see troubleshooting section)
- Meshtastic Python library installed (`pip install meshtastic` or simply `pip install -r requirements.txt` if source code was pulled)


### Message Filtering
```bash
# Control which message types are forwarded to Discord
SHOW_TEXT_MESSAGES=true        # Chat messages between nodes
SHOW_POSITION_UPDATES=true     # GPS location broadcasts
SHOW_NODE_INFO=true            # Device information and names
SHOW_TELEMETRY=true            # Battery, temperature, etc.
SHOW_ROUTING=false             # Network routing information (usually noisy)
SHOW_ADMIN=true                # Administrative commands
SHOW_DETECTION_SENSOR=true     # Motion/presence detection
SHOW_RANGE_TEST=true           # Signal testing messages
SHOW_STORE_FORWARD=true        # Delayed message delivery
SHOW_UNKNOWN=false             # Unrecognized message types

# Signal strength reporting (optional)
SHOW_SIGNAL_STRENGTH=true      # Include SNR and RSSI data in messages
```

## Message Format Examples

### Text Message (with signal strength)
```
üìª **Meshtastic Radio** | **Alice (12345678)** | <t:1640995200:t>
üí¨ Hello from the mesh network!
üì∂ SNR: 5.2 | RSSI: -85
```

### Text Message (without signal strength)
```
üìª **Meshtastic Radio** | **Alice (12345678)** | <t:1640995200:t>
üí¨ Hello from the mesh network!
```

### Position Update
```
üìª **Meshtastic Radio** | **Bob's Radio (87654321)** | <t:1640995300:t>
üìç Position update
üì∂ SNR: 3.1 | RSSI: -92
```

### Telemetry Data
```
üìª **Meshtastic Radio** | **Weather Station (abcdef12)** | <t:1640995400:t>
üìä Telemetry data
üì∂ SNR: 7.8 | RSSI: -78
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Messages Appearing
1. **Check Discord Permissions**: Ensure bot has "Send Messages" permission
2. **Verify Channel ID**: Confirm `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` is correct
3. **Serial Connection Issues**: Check USB device connectivity and permissions
4. **Message Filtering**: Verify enabled message types in configuration

#### Serial Connection Problems

**Device Permission Issues:**
```bash
# Check device permissions (Linux/macOS)
ls -la /dev/tty*

# For macOS, you might need:
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $USER -t user wheel

# Verify device path
dmesg | grep tty  # Linux
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -A 5 -B 5 "Meshtastic"  # macOS
```

**Docker Serial Connection:**
```bash
# Ensure device is mapped correctly
docker run --device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 ...

# For Docker Compose, ensure devices section is correct:
devices:
  - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"

# For Linux, ensure permissions are correct
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```

**Serial Port Detection:**
```bash
# Test Meshtastic connection
meshtastic --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --info
```


### Debug Mode
Enable comprehensive logging:
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### Serial Connection

Previously this app supported both http and serial connections. However there were extreme drawbacks to http and tons of lost data and connection issues, so those have been deprecated to serial only

**Serial Connection Advantages:**
- Direct USB access to the Meshtastic device provides maximum reliability
- Real-time message delivery as packets arrive at the radio
- No network connectivity required on the device
- Robust error handling with automatic recovery from connection issues

## Serial Connection Details

**How Serial Connection Works:**
- Uses the Meshtastic Python library for direct device communication
- Receives packets in real-time as they arrive at the radio
- Requires physical USB connection to the device
- Automatic connection recovery - will reset serial connection if 240 seconds passes with no connection (configurable via `SERIAL_TIMEOUT` variable)
- All messages received by radio are queued up and passed along in sequence without loss

**Serial Reliability Note:** While the underlying serial connection can experience occasional data corruption and protocol errors (common with USB/serial communications), Meshcord includes robust error handling that automatically recovers from these issues. You may see occasional parsing errors in the logs, but these are safely handled and do not affect message forwarding. Meshtastic logging is "chatty" and these errors can mostly be ignored.
